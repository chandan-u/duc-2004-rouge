<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>He brings heavy baggage: right-wing intransigence and responsibility for failing to prevent the killings of 460 unarmed Palestinians in refugee camps during the Lebanon incursion.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Sharon has said that he will not shake Arafat's hand and his appointment is seen as a "bullet of mercy" for the Middle East peace process.</a>
