<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>During the Clinton impeachment debate in the House, Speaker-elect Bob Livingston declared that he would set an example for the president and resign from Congress over revelations of his marital infidelities.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Republican demands that the president also resign were rejected by Democrats who also said that Livingston should not quit and that the Speaker-elect's resignation was, in the words of Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y), "a surrender to sexual McCarthyism".</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>With the House vote to impeach, the president will face a Senate trial, but it is unlikely that 67 members will vote for conviction.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>The trial could be mercifully shortened, however, by a vote of censure.</a>
