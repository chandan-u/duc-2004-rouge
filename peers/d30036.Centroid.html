<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>A day after winning the Nobel Prize for literature, Portuguese novelist Jose Saramago insisted that while he was delighted to win the award, it could just as easily have gone to many other Portuguese writers.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>He said that he knew that previous Nobel prize winners had nominated him for the award, but that he still was somewhat surprised to receive it.</a>
