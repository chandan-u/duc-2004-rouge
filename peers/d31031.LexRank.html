<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>A sticking point for White House and congressional budget negotiators has been the issue of how the 2000 census will be conducted, and the White House is finding itself negotiating on the issue as much with House Democrats as it is with the House Republican leaders.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>And Democrats on Tuesday expressed concern over some White House positions, on issues like the census and an apparent compromise with Republicans on aid for farmers.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>But House Democrats balked at the idea of six months financing for the census, arguing that even if the Supreme Court allowed sampling, the Republicans would be under no obligation to approve money for a census that included sampling.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>But House Democrats were not consulted before that agreement was struck and later grumbled about it.</a>
