<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Hun Sen said his current government would remain in power as long as the opposition refused to form a new one.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Negotiations to form the next government have become deadlocked, and opposition party leaders Prince Norodom Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy are out of the country following threats of arrest from strongman Hun Sen. Hun Sen complained Monday that the opposition was trying to make its members return an international issue.</a>
