The airport opening had been held up for two years because of disputes between Israel and the Palestinian Authority over Israel's role in monitoring passengers and cargo.
Disputes between Israel and the Palestinian Authority over security had delayed the airport opening for more than two years.
The airport protocol was signed last week, as part of the Wye River land-for-security deal between Israel and the Palestinians.
The airport's opening last month, stipulated by the accords brokered by U.S. President Bill Clinton at Wye River, Maryland in October, was hailed by Palestinians as a milestone toward independence and statehood.
