Demirel consulted Turkey's party leaders immediately after Ecevit gave up.
Turkey's secular parties are under pressure to join forces to keep the Islamic Virtue Party out of power.
Opposition parties lodged no-confidence motions Wednesday against Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz after allegations he interfered in the privatization of a bank and helped a businessman linked to a mobster.
By tradition, Demirel should then have asked the leader of Parliament's largest party to form a new government.
Ecevit tried in vain to form a coalition government with two rival center-right wing parties -- one led by Yilmaz, the other by former Prime Minister Tansu Ciller.
Ecevit refused even to consult with the leader of the Virtue Party during his efforts to form a government.
