A fire turned a Swedish dance hall jammed with teen-age Halloween revelers into a deathtrap, killing 60 people and injuring 155.
Prime Minister Goeran Persson visited the fire site at midday and King Carl XVI Gustav made a statement of condolence.
The fast-spreading fire completely gutted the building and left rescuers facing a hideous scene that local rescue service leader Lennart Olin likened to a gas chamber.
Binan Atta was walking to the Macedonian Association when he saw the fire.
The fire, at the facilities of the Macedonian Association local immigrant group, was the deadliest in modern Swedish history.
The Macedonian Association had rented the facility out for the dance, Carlsson said.
At a news conference Friday morning, police said most victims choked to death on smoke and poisonous gases.
