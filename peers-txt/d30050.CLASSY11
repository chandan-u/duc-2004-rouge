Matt Foreman, executive director of the Empire State Pride Agenda, cited D'Amato's role as "the architect" of the state Republican Party as a major reason the group endorsed Schumer.
The group tends to favor incumbents, has been searching for allies among the Senate Republican majority and considers D'Amato's recent record on gay issues to be quite strong.
White House officials and gay Democrats, concerned that the nation's largest gay and lesbian political organization is about to endorse Sen. Alfonse D'Amato for re-election, are intensely lobbying the group to try to shift its support to the Democratic challenger, Rep. Charles Schumer.
