Executives representing Netscape, AOL and Sun Microsystems are government witnesses at the Microsoft trial.
Even before the Netscape deal, America Online was moving to provide some electronic commerce software and services.
America Online Inc. wants to become the next Microsoft in two promising information-age fields where Microsoft Corp. is just another company the Internet media business and electronic commerce.
Microsoft Corp. argued in federal court Monday that the proposed acquisition of Netscape Communications Corp. by America Online seriously undermined the government's antitrust suit against the software giant.
Sun Microsystems, analysts say, could be a strong partner for AOL in the market for Internet commerce software.
Some competitors worry that America Online's electronic commerce services may simply be a device to sell its software and hardware.
