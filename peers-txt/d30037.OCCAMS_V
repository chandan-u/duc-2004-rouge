Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu named Sharon foreign minister on Friday, effectively putting the hard-liner in charge of negotiating Israel's final borders with the Palestinians.
Many Arabs know Sharon for his role in Israel's 1982 invasion of Lebanon.
At the table is a U.S plan for an Israeli troop withdrawal from 13 percent from the West Bank.
Netanyahu's government rejected that agreement, saying it was never completed.
Syrian-Israeli peace talks broke off more than two years ago.
Ariel Sharon's appointment as the Israeli foreign minister serves as "the bullet of mercy" for the Middle East peace process.
