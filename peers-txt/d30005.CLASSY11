That excuse is Osama bin Laden, the man Washington calls Enemy No. 1 and blames for the Aug. 7 bombings of U.S. embassies in East Africa.
Bin Laden's organization was a significant concern for the Clinton administration even before the bombing of the U.S. embassies in East Africa.
Thus far, U.S. prosecutors have charged at least six members of bin Laden's organization with terrorist activities or conspiracy.
The informant worked closely with bin Laden from 1989 to 1996, a period when prosecutors assert that bin Laden was ordering deadly attacks on U.S. soldiers in Somalia and elsewhere.
