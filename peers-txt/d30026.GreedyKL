This new software, which now will be combined with Netscape's online store services, will be available for companies to use both on America Online and on the Internet.
America Online Inc. wants to become the next Microsoft in two promising information-age fields where Microsoft Corp. is just another company the Internet media business and electronic commerce.
AOL believes it has the expertise to increase revenues from Netscape's Web site and, helped by Sun's programmers and vast corporate sales force, to accelerate Netscape's software sales as well, executives involved in the negotiations said.
And the serious merger talks between Netscape Chief Executive Officer James Barksdale and AOL Chairman Steve Case began about a month ago, or just after the start of the Microsoft trial, according to people close to the talks.
