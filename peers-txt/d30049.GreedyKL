In meetings this week in Pyongyang, the North Korean capital, U.S. officials were rebuffed in their request to see the suspicious site, which American intelligence officials fear could be a secret effort to revive the North's nuclear weapons program.
The talks ended as Clinton began a trip to Asia that will include a visit to South Korea, where the issue of the North Korean construction site is expected to be among the major topics discussed with President Kim Dae-jung.
The United States and North Korea are set to resume talks Friday about inspections of an underground North Korean site suspected of being used to produce nuclear weapons.
The Clinton administration fears that the construction site may be evidence that North Korea has abandoned a 1994 pledge to the United States to give up its nuclear weapons program in exchange for billions of dollars in aid.
