Matthew Shepard, the gay college student who was kidnapped and severely beaten, died here Monday, five days after he was found unconscious on a Wyoming ranch where he had been left tied to a fence for 18 hours in near-freezing temperatures.
Matthew Wayne Shepard, the gay student who was beaten in the dead of night, tied to a fence and left to die alone, was mourned at his funeral Friday by 1,000 people, including many who had never met him.
Shepard's friends call the attack a hate crime.
Shepard joined the campus gay association at the university within days.
Gay leaders hope and Christian conservatives fear that Shepard's death will galvanize Congress and state legislatures to pass hate-crime legislation or broaden existing laws.
