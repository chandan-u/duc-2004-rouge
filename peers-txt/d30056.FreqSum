Chechen security forces are still searching for the men's bodies.
The severed heads of the four hostages were found lined up Tuesday along a highway outside Chechnya's capital, Grozny.
Mansur Tagirov vanished Thursday evening while returning to Chechnya's capital city Grozny from a small village nearby, news reports said.
Chechen President Aslan Maskhadov said in Grozny that the bodies of four men had been recovered.
Chechen President Aslan Maskhadov will allow British government agents to come to Chechnya to investigate the killing, Atgeriyev said, according to the Interfax news agency.
His release came four days after the severed heads of four foreign hostages were found in Chechnya when a government rescue attempt apparently went wrong.
Assailants have abducted Chechnya's top prosecutor, who was investigating the killings of four kidnapped foreigners, officials said Friday.
