Hun Sen's Cambodian People's Party won 64 of the 122 parliamentary seats in July's elections, short of the two-thirds majority needed to form a government on its own.
The alleged assassination attempt came during massive street demonstrations organized by the opposition after Hun Sen's Cambodian People's Party narrowly won the election.
The royalist party also rejected Hun Sen's calls to hold bilateral talks, insisting that Ranariddh's main ally Sam Rainsy also be included.
A new partnership between the parties of strongman Hun Sen and his rival, Prince Norodom Ranariddh, in a coalition government would not end in more violence.
