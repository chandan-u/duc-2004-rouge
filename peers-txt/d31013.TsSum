Both Kopp and Weslin have been arrested repeatedly during abortion protests.
Violence at abortion clinics is only part of the problem.
Now, Kopp is being sought by federal and local law enforcement authorities for questioning as a material witness in the murder of an obstetrician who performed abortions in the Buffalo region.
Federal authorities first organized an abortion clinic task force in 1995 after the killing of a Florida doctor.
Federal law enforcement officials and the authorities say Kopp is not now a suspect in the sniper attack on Oct. 23 that killed Dr. Barnett A. Slepian near Buffalo.
He asked Slepian how performing abortions affected him spiritually.
James Kopp, the man the FBI is seeking as a material witness in the sniper slaying of Dr. Barnett Slepian, is known to abortion rights leaders as an aggressive anti-abortion protester, and law enforcement officials say he has been arrested several times in demonstrations at abortion clinics.
