The astronauts will use the shuttle robot arm to capture the Russian space station piece and attach it to Unity.
Currie took almost two hours to painstakingly move Zarya above the American-made Unity docking port positioned in Endeavour's cargo bay.
The 240-mile-high construction job began two hours earlier with Nancy Currie's capture of Zarya( Russian for Sunrise) using the shuttle robot arm.
Mission Control ordered the pilots to fire the shuttle thrusters to put an extra three miles between Endeavour and the space junk, putting Endeavour a total of five miles from the orbiting debris.
Aboard Endeavour is an American-made connecting passageway named Unity.
For the second day in a row, astronauts boarded space shuttle Endeavour on Friday for liftoff on NASA's first space station construction flight.
