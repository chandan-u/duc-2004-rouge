By one vote, a defector from its own ranks, Premier Romano Prodi's center-left coalition, Italy's second-longest serving government since World War II, lost a confidence vote Friday in the Chamber of Deputies.
If the crisis comes to a confidence vote and Prodi loses, he would offer his resignation.
The government has a majority in the Senate even without Refoundation's support.
The leader of the Communist Refounding Party in Parliament, Fausto Bertinotti, seems to have no such compunctions.
Oscar Luigi Scalfaro could ask Prodi to try again with a new majority.
The break with Prodi's government divided Refoundation.
