Bin Laden is believed to be living in Afghanistan.
The United States has obtained new evidence to link the owner of a Sudanese factory destroyed in a U.S. cruise missile strike last month to a terrorist group backed by Osama bin Laden, the suspected mastermind of the bombings of two U.S. embassies in East Africa, according to U.S. intelligence officials.
Without any evidence, bin Laden is a man without sin.
This evidence was uncovered after the United States destroyed Idris factory in a missile attack following the bombing of the U.S. embassies, the officials said.
Thus far, U.S. prosecutors have charged at least six members of bin Laden's organization with terrorist activities or conspiracy.
Police seized copies of the newspaper for reproducing a foreign newspaper interview of Afghanistan-based Saudi billionaire Osama Bin Laden, who has been accused by the United States of masterminding bombing attacks on the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in August.
