Chinese courts sentenced dissidents Xu Wenli and Wang Youcai to 13 and 11 years for trying to organize an opposition political party.
All three were charged with trying to subvert China's Communist Party-led system.
The U.S. government and exiled dissidents, many of whom supported the party's efforts, denounced the sentences and called for the dissidents"release."
Xu became openly involved in the China Democracy Party in November.
Xu, 55, edited an underground journal in the Democracy Wall movement 20 years ago and spent 12 years in prison, mostly in solitary confinement.
1 Intermediate People's Court Monday for Xu's trial.
