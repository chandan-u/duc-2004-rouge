The Australian Maritime Safety Authority alerted all shipping in Bass Strait as high winds and huge seas smash into the remnants of the 115-boat fleet.
The two dead were found on the 40-foot vessel Business Post Naiad, about 100 kilometers (60 miles) off the New South Wales state town of Merimbula.
Three yachts remain missing and there was no sign of a sailor swept off the Sword of Orion when the boat rolled in wild seas on Sunday night.
Race spokesman Peter Campbell said it was not known how long the sailor washed overboard could survive in the water.
