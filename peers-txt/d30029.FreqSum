Two sailors died and 15 others were missing after gale-force winds and high seas battered yachts in the Sydney-to-Hobart yacht race Monday.
Despite the conditions, Race spokesman Peter Campbell said it was unlikely the race would be called off.
Race officials said Guy sailed in two previous Sydney to Hobart yacht races.
A police helicopter rescued a yachtsman swept overboard when the Victorian yacht Kingurra was rolled over in huge seas 19 nautical miles south of Gabo Island.
Race spokesman Peter Campbell said it was not known how long the sailor washed overboard could survive in the water.
AMSA spokesman David Gray said about 50 sailors had been winched to safety in this year's race.
The yacht's owner-skipper Bruce Guy and first-time race participant Phil Skeggs were killed.
