Opposition parties lodged no-confidence motions Wednesday against Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz after allegations he interfered in the privatization of a bank and helped a businessman linked to a mobster.
Ecevit, a veteran leftist, was called on to form a cabinet over two weeks ago after Mesut Yilmaz coalition government collapsed in a no-confidence vote in Parliament.
Ecevit tried in vain to form a coalition government with two rival center-right wing parties -- one led by Yilmaz, the other by former Prime Minister Tansu Ciller.
Turkey's secular parties are under pressure to join forces to keep the Islamic Virtue Party out of power.
It is now clear that no party leader can form a government that can win a vote of confidence, former Premier Mesut Yilmaz said after talks with Demirel.
