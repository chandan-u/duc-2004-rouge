Clinton is to meet with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat on Monday in the Gaza Strip.
Israel says Yasser Arafat's Palestinian Authority is orchestrating the street fighting.
Who invited President Clinton to the Gaza Strip?
Thousands of police were deployed throughout Israel during the Clinton visit.
Clinton said the United States shares Israel's concerns about security.
Clinton's visit to Gaza and his address to the Palestinian National Council is seen by some as a boost for dreams of Palestinian statehood.
President Clinton will travel to Gaza next month to address Palestinian leaders, the White House said Friday.
The Palestinian leader also said he hoped Clinton would exert pressure on Israel to keep its obligations under the Wye agreement.
Also Sunday, another quarrel was brewing over the scheduled meeting of the Palestinian National Council, the Palestinian parliament-in-exile, in the Gaza Strip during Clinton's visit.
