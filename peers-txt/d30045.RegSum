Which is why Mobil and Exxon are considering combining into the world's largest oil company.
Oil stocks led the way as investors soaked up the news of continuing talks between Exxon and Mobil on a merger that would create the world's largest oil company.
Back when Standard Oil organized its operations by state, Exxon was Standard Oil of New Jersey, while Mobil was Standard Oil of New York.
Still, Big Oil and small oil are getting squeezed by low petroleum prices and the high capital costs of exploration.
Exxon Corp. and Mobil Corp. have held discussions about combining their business operations, a person involved in the talks said Wednesday.
A combined company would be bigger than Royal Dutch/Shell Group, the world's largest oil company by revenue.
