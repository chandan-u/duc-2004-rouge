The worst previous Swedish fire disaster in modern history was in 1978 in Boraas, when 20 people died in a hotel fire.
A fire turned a Swedish dance hall jammed with teen-age Halloween revelers into a deathtrap, killing 60 people and injuring 155.
About 300 or 400 people were inside, police said.
Binan Atta was walking to the Macedonian Association when he saw the fire.
Of the 162 people who suffered non-fatal injuries in the Thursday night fire, 76 remain hospitalized.
The fire broke out about midnight( 2300 GMT Thursday) in building of the local Macedonian Association, which organized the dance.
Olin said there were signs that the fire was set.
Police said the list of injured included Somalis and people from current and former Yugoslavia.
