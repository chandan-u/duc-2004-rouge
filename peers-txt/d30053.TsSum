Who invited President Clinton to the Gaza Strip?
Clinton is to meet with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat on Monday in the Gaza Strip.
In an atmosphere of political tension, U.S. President Clinton met Sunday with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in a bid to put the troubled Wye River peace accord back on track.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday accused Yasser Arafat of making a farce of the Wye River accords and said he would not agree to further troop withdrawals until a halt to anti-Israel violence.
Again, the Israeli leader accused the Palestinians of ignoring commitments in peace accords.
The Wye accord says delegates should reaffirm the Arafat letter to Clinton, but does not specifically refer to a vote.
