British sailor Glyn Charles was swept off the Sword of Orion on Sunday night when the boat rolled in wild seas.
The two dead were found on the 40-foot vessel Business Post Naiad, about 100 kilometers (60 miles) off the New South Wales state town of Merimbula.
Race spokesman Peter Campbell said it was not known how long the sailor washed overboard could survive in the water.
Gale-force winds and high seas battered yachts in Australia's Sydney-to-Hobart race Monday, killing at least two crew members and leaving three yachts missing.
Gray said about 56 sailors had been winched to safety.
