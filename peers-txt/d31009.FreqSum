Demirel consulted Turkey's party leaders immediately after Ecevit gave up.
Ecevit refused even to consult with the leader of the Virtue Party during his efforts to form a government.
Turkey's staunchly secular military opposes the return of an Islamic-led government.
By tradition, Demirel should then have asked the leader of Parliament's largest party to form a new government.
Ecevit was expected to meet with Yilmaz on Thursday, and other party leaders Friday.
Bulent Ecevit of the Democratic Left Party failed in a 3-week-old attempt to form a government that could command a majority of votes in Parliament.
Turkey has been trying to form a new government since a coalition government led by Yilmaz collapsed last month over allegations that he rigged the sale of a bank.
