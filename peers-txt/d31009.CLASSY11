Premier-designate Bulent Ecevit needs Turkey's two-center right parties to hammer together a secular coalition, but Tansu Ciller, the ex-premier who commands 99 votes in parliament, rebuffed him Wednesday.
Erez took over efforts to form a government last week after veteran leftist Bulent Ecevit gave up, unable to convince Turkey's bickering center-left and center-right parties to join him in a coalition that excluded the Islamic-oriented party.
Turkey has been trying to form a new government since a coalition government led by Yilmaz collapsed last month over allegations that he rigged the sale of a bank.
