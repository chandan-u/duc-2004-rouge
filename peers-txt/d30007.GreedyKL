The rebels ethnic Tutsis, disenchanted members of President Laurent Kabila's army and opposition politicians took up arms Aug. 2 accusing Kabila of mismanagement, corruption and creating division among Congo's 400 tribes.
If the rebels succeed in capturing Kindu, 380 kilometers( 235 miles) west of Goma, the rebel headquarters, this will remove the last government stronghold in eastern Congo and pave the way for rebel advance into the mineral-rich southwest.
On Saturday, the rebels said they shot down a Congolese Boeing 727 which was attempting to land at Kindu air base with 40 troops and ammunition.
After an initial lightning advance in the far west of Africa's third-largest nation, the rebels were stopped at the outskirts of the capital, Kinshasa, by troops from Angola, Zimbabwe and Namibia, who are backing Kabila.
