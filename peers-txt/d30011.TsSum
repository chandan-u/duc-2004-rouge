On Sept. 2, Malaysia's Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad fired Anwar, calling him morally unfit for office.
Anwar was fired by Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad on Sept. 2 after the two differed on economic policy.
Jailed, beaten and facing trial on 10 sexual misconduct and corruption charges, ousted Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim is a political underdog in Malaysia.
But the prime minister said the deputy was fired because he was morally unfit.
Anwar is a charismatic politician who was once picked to be the successor to Malaysia's long-serving Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad.
Mahathir and Anwar had differed over economic policy and Anwar says Mahathir feared him as an alternative leader.
The arrest of former Malaysian Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim won't lead to massive social unrest or frighten away investors, Malaysia's trade minister said Thursday.
