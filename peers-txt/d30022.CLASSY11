Qin and Xu are towering figures in China's persecuted dissident community.
Wang argued that his activities were legal under China's constitution and under an international covenant on political rights that China has signed.
Monday, Wang's wife, Hu Jiangxia, was handed the bill of prosecution, according to the Information Center of Human Rights and Democratic Movement in Hong Kong.
The arrests of Xu and Qin at their homes Monday night and the accusations against them and Wang were the sharpest action Chinese leaders have taken since dissidents began pushing to set up and legally register the China Democracy Party in June.
