Lahoud had been expected to issue a presidential decree last week asking Hariri to form the next government after the president polled members of the 128-seat Parliament on their choice for prime minister.
Lahoud, 62, commander of Lebanon's army who was propelled to power with widespread popular backing, pledged in a tough inauguration speech to clean up the graft-riddled administration.
Prime Minister Rafik Hariri has declined an informal invitation from Lebanon's new president to form the next government, sparking a political crisis in this country as it rebuilds from its devastating civil war.
Lahoud is to be sworn for a six-year term on Nov. 24, the day President Elias Hrawi leaves office.
Lahoud, appointed army commander in 1989 amid a rebellion in the fractured military during the 1975-90 civil war, is credited with rebuilding the 55,000-strong Lebanese army and in ending the reign of militias.
