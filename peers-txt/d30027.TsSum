Central Bank Chairman Viktor Gerashchenko and Finance Minister Mikhail Zadornov flew to Washington on Friday for negotiations with the IMF over the dlrs 4.3 billion installment.
Russian companies stashed about dlrs 2.5 billion outside the country in September alone, the Interfax news agency reported Friday, quoting central bank figures.
Primakov may be opposed to wildly unpopular currency controls.
In recent months, Kuchma has implemented some economic reforms by decree, prompting the International Monetary Fund to release the first installment of a long-awaited dlrs 2.2 billion loan.
Primakov said foreign investors are the force that will help Russia to minimize its losses from the current economic crisis.
Viktor Gerashchenko, the central bank chairman, said on Friday that the government must act to stem the flow of dollars from Russia.
