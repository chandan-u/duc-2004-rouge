Last week, Hun Sen's Cambodian People's Party and Ranariddh's FUNCINPEC party agreed to form a coalition that would leave Hun Sen as sole prime minister and make the prince president of the National Assembly.
The CPP fell short of the two-thirds majority needed to form a government alone.
Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy have remained outside the country since the Sept. 24 ceremonial convening of parliament.
A new partnership between the parties of strongman Hun Sen and his rival, Prince Norodom Ranariddh, in a coalition government would not end in more violence.
The Senate will initially be appointed by the king.
