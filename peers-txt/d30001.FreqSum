Hun Sen ordered police to break up the demonstrations.
The agreement will make Hun Sen prime minister and Ranariddh president of the National Assembly.
Their arguments turned bloody last year when Hun Sen ousted Ranariddh in a coup.
Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy have charged that Hun Sen's victory in the elections was achieved through widespread fraud.
Hun Sen's ruling party narrowly won a majority in elections in July, but the opposition claiming widespread intimidation and fraud has denied Hun Sen the two-thirds vote in parliament required to approve the next government.
Hun Sen's Cambodian People's Party dropped insistence on a joint assembly chairmanship shared by Ranariddh and party boss Chea Sim, the current speaker.
The royalist party also rejected Hun Sen's calls to hold bilateral talks, insisting that Ranariddh's main ally Sam Rainsy also be included.
