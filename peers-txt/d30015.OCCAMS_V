In Brussels, Belgium, however, U.S. special envoy Richard Holbrooke told reporters Monday that the situation in Kosovo has not improved.
At the United Nations, Secretary-General Kofi Annan said Yugoslav forces had increased their attacks on Kosovo's ethnic Albanians even after a U.N. resolution demanded a cease-fire.
"The threats are serious," Prime Minister Momir Bulatovic said.
, the head of Yugoslavia's other republic, Montenegro, called on Milosevic to accept all international demands and avert a NATO attack.
Serbian police and the Yugoslav army have routed separatist Kosovo Albanian rebels in the crackdown that began in late February.
