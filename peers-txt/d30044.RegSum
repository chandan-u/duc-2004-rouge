Italian authorities captured Abdullah Ocalan at Rome's international airport Thursday.
The detention in Italy of Kurdish rebel leader Ocalan prompted widespread protests by Kurds throughout Europe.
Turkey stepped up pressure on Italy for the extradition of captured Kurdish rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan, saying Sunday that granting him asylum would amount to opening doors to terrorism.
Turkey wants Italy to extradite the rebel, Abdullah Ocalan, leader of the Kurdistan Workers Party, which is seeking Kurdish autonomy in southeastern Turkey.
About 1,500 Kurds who spent the night outside a military hospital where Kurdish rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan is believed held continued their hunger strike Monday to protest his detention.
Turkey has asked for his extradition and Ocalan has asked for political asylum.
