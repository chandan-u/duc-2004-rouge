Israel retains security control over flights arriving to Gaza International Airport.
Israeli airport security officials were not available for comment.
Israel's government does not permit Israelis to use the Palestinian airport, citing security reasons.
As part of the latest Mideast peace accord, Israeli and Palestinian officials were to sign a protocol for the airport Friday and Palestinian negotiators said Gaza International Airport would open Sunday.
Disputes between Israel and the Palestinian Authority over security had delayed the airport opening for more than two years.
Earlier this week, Israel threatened to close down the Gaza airport when Palestinian airport workers refused to allow Israeli security officials to check the identity of passengers who arrived on an Egyptian plane, most of whom worked for the Palestinian Authority.
