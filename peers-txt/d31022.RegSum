A fire turned a Swedish dance hall jammed with teen-age Halloween revelers into a deathtrap, killing 60 people and injuring 155.
The fire, at the facilities of the Macedonian Association local immigrant group, was the deadliest in modern Swedish history.
The fast-spreading fire completely gutted the building and left rescuers facing a hideous scene that local rescue service leader Lennart Olin likened to a gas chamber.
Police said the list of injured included Somalis and people from current and former Yugoslavia.
The fire destroyed the building, whose second floor, where the dance took place, was rented by the local Macedonian immigrant association in Sweden's second-largest city.
The Goteborg rescue services also brought city buses into service to help transport the injured.
