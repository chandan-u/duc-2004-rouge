Hagel lambasted the Republican leadership for the election outcome.
Speaker Newt Gingrich said in Marietta, Ga., that the Republicans still held onto the House for three elections in a row for the first time since the election of 1932.
The Democratic surge marked the first time since 1934 that the president's party had gained seats in a midterm election, and it whittled the Republican House majority down to a mere six votes.
While Gingrich has not gone out of his way to identify himself with the Republican campaign's last-minute ad blitz attacking President Clinton, his caucus knows he is responsible.
