Who invited President Clinton to the Gaza Strip?
Clinton is to meet with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat on Monday in the Gaza Strip.
Keeping a promise to Israel and the United States, Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat on Thursday convened senior officials and legislators to revoke clauses of the PLO founding charter calling for Israel's destruction.
Again, the Israeli leader accused the Palestinians of ignoring commitments in peace accords.
Israel says Yasser Arafat's Palestinian Authority is orchestrating the street fighting.
In an atmosphere of political tension, U.S. President Clinton met Sunday with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in a bid to put the troubled Wye River peace accord back on track.
The Palestinians are making a farce out of the Wye River accord.
