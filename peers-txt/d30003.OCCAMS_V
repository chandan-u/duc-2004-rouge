Pinochet was arrested in London on Oct. 16 at the instigation of Spanish magistrate Baltasar Garzon who is seeking to extradite the former dictator on charges of genocide, terrorism and torture.
Swiss authorities said the Spanish effort to extradite Pinochet should be given priority.
Any legal defense would be up to Pinochet's family.
British police, detained the ailing general in the London clinic where he was recovering from back surgery.
Public prosecutors from Spain's National Court have appealed the judicial investigations into human rights abuses in Chile and Argentina that underpin Garzon's arrest warrant.
