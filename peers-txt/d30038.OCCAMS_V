The International Olympic Committee has ordered a top-level investigation into the payment of nearly dlrs 400,000 in scholarships to relatives of IOC members by the Salt Lake group which won the bid for the 2002 Winter Games.
"We trust the organizing committee of Salt Lake City."
Asked whether he might resign, Hodler said, "No, I don't resign."
Hodler said a group of four agents, have been involved in promising votes for payment.
IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch immediately disassociated himself from Hodler's allegations.
"The only official spokeman for the IOC executive board is (director general) Francois Carrard".
