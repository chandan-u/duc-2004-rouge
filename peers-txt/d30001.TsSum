Cambodia's bickering political parties broke a three-month deadlock Friday and agreed to a coalition government leaving strongman Hun Sen as sole prime minister, King Norodom Sihanouk announced.
The agreement will make Hun Sen prime minister and Ranariddh president of the National Assembly.
Ranariddh's party and opposition ally Sam Rainsy held back their support, claiming the CPP won due to fraud and intimidation.
Cambodian leader Hun Sen on Friday rejected opposition parties demands for talks outside the country, accusing them of trying to internationalize the political crisis.
Government and opposition parties have asked King Norodom Sihanouk to host a summit meeting after a series of post-election negotiations between the two opposition groups and Hun Sen's party to form a new government failed.
