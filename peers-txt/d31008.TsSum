Shepard's friends call the attack a hate crime.
Gay leaders charge that these advertisements help create a hostile climate for homosexuals, a climate that can lead to violence.
Here in Laramie, McKinney's father, Bill, also condemned the attack.
Ms. Pasley, a freshman art student at the university, lived with Henderson.
He said they found Shepard's wallet at McKinney's home.
In Denver, mourners wrote messages on a graffiti wall as part of national Gay Awareness Week.
Two men, Russell Henderson, 21, and Aaron McKinney, 22, were arraigned late Monday night on first-degree murder charges.
But Christian conservatives warn that gay leaders want to use Shepard's death to expand hate rights laws and to curtail freedom of speech.
