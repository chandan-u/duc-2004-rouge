YANKEES Pitching The starting pitching enabled the Yankees to advance past Cleveland in the American League Championship Series.

But in 1969, baseball began league championship series, and in 1995 it began a two-layered playoff system.
Martinez could joke about the bats being specially designed for the World Series because the Yankees began their quest for a second title in the past three years when they play host to the San Diego Padres in Game 1 at Yankee Stadium Saturday night.
San Diego led, 5-2, and Yankee Stadium was silent.
As Bernie Williams starts what could be his final series with the Yankees in Game 1 of the World Series at Yankee Stadium Saturday night, he wants to do it with a free mind.
