The Yugoslav war crimes tribunal cleared Zejnil Delalic, a Muslim, of responsibility for war crimes committed against Serb captives at a Bosnian government-run prison camp under his command.
The Yugoslav war crimes tribunal Monday acquitted a Muslim commander of war crimes against Bosnian Serb prisoners in 1992, but convicted three underlings in the first U.N. case dealing with anti-Serb atrocities.
Prosecutor Grant Niemann of Australia said he would appeal Delalic's acquittal.
Mucic also was cleared of responsibility for four murders and three cases of mistreatment or torture of prisoners.
Delic was cleared of two murders, and of command responsibility for other killings at Celebici.
Inmates at the Celebici prison camp were beaten to death by guards wielding baseball bats, wooden planks and rifle butts, according to testimony.
