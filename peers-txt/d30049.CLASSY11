North Korea has abandoned a 1994 pledge to the United States to give up its nuclear weapons program in exchange for billions of dollars in aid.
The North Koreans have denied that the complex, former North Korean nuclear research center, is intended to be used for a nuclear weapons program.
They have demanded that the United States pay $300 million to inspect it, a request rejected this week by a U.S. delegation to Pyongyang, the North Korean capital.
Clinton acknowledged that U.S. intelligence officials are not yet certain that the underground construction project in North Korea is nuclear related.
