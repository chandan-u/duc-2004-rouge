Parliament on Thursday formally elected Gen. Emile Lahoud, the popular army commander who has the backing of powerful neighbor Syria, as Lebanon's next president.
Prime Minister Rafik Hariri has declined an informal invitation from Lebanon's new president to form the next government, sparking a political crisis in this country as it rebuilds from its devastating civil war.
The general enjoys widespread popular backing after succeeding in rebuilding an army fractured by civil war.
Lahoud, 62, a former commander of Lebanon's army, was propelled to power with widespread popular backing.
Hariri is credited with restoring economic confidence and stabilizing the national currency.
Prime Minister Rafik Hariri's efforts to win a fourth term in office have hit a snag after he failed to receive the expected speedy appointment from new President Emile Lahoud.
