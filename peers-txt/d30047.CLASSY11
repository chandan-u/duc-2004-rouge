Endeavour's astronauts connected the first two building blocks of the international space station on Sunday, creating a seven-story tower in the shuttle cargo bay.
It will provide all of the necessary electricity and steering for the fledgling space station until a permanent control module can be launched next summer.
The space station will not be inhabitable until early 2000, following the launch of a Russian crew module which is set to blast off next July or August.
The Russian space agency has sold research time on the station to NASA for dlrs 60 million to complete the segment.
