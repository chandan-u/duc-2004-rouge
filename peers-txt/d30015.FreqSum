The Russians are against using NATO force in Kosovo.
Milosevic was apparently accusing Holbrooke of supporting the ethnic Albanian guerrillas of the Kosovo Liberation Army, who have been fighting to make the Serbian province of Kosovo an independent nation.
Kosovo is a province of Serbia, the main republic of Yugoslavia.
Holbrooke said he would tell Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic of the extreme gravity of the situation.
Serbian police and the Yugoslav army have routed separatist Kosovo Albanian rebels in the crackdown that began in late February.
Milosevic met Sunday with Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov and Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev, Serbian President Milan Milutinovic and Yugoslavia's top defense officials.
Holbrooke is en route to Belgrade for a meeting with Milosevic.
