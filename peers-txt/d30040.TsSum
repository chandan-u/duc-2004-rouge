Israel retains security control over flights arriving to Gaza International Airport.
Officials said Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat may travel by car to Egypt in order to fly into the airport.
Israeli airport security officials were not available for comment.
As part of the latest Mideast peace accord, Israeli and Palestinian officials were to sign a protocol for the airport Friday and Palestinian negotiators said Gaza International Airport would open Sunday.
Disputes between Israel and the Palestinian Authority over security had delayed the airport opening for more than two years.
Israeli officials also delayed a plane making a stopover from Saudi Arabia to Cairo, it said.
Palestinian airport workers refused to allow Israeli security officials to check the identity of passengers who arrived on an Egyptian plane Sunday afternoon, most of whom worked for the Palestinian Authority, according to Civilian Airport Authority Director Nir Yarkoni.
