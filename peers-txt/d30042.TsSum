TRIPOLI, Libya( AP) U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan arrived in Libya Saturday for talks aimed at bringing to trial two Libyan suspects in the 1988 Pan Am bombing over Lockerbie, Scotland.
Annan's one-day visit to meet with Libyan leader Col. Moammar Gadhafi followed reports in the Libyan media that Gadhafi had no authority to hand over the suspects.
Qatar's foreign minister, Sheik Hamad bin Jassem bin Jaber Al Thani, met Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi in the desert on Saturday, Libya's official television reported.
Annan's meeting with Gadhafi took place after Libya's official news agency, JANA, initially reported that Annan might not be able to meet with the Libyan leader because Gadhafi was in the desert.
He credited Annan's talks with Omar al-Muntasser, Libya's foreign minister, who met with Annan in Sirte before Annan went on to talks with Gadhafi.
