The cause of the fire was not immediately known.
Olin said there were indications that the fire could have been set.
The Macedonian Association had rented the facility out for the dance.
About 180 people were taken to hospitals.
About 300 or 400 people were inside.
The hall was packed far beyond its capacity.
The crowd was mostly teen-agers and mostly immigrants or children of immigrant parents.
The blaze was already consuming the building.
