Milosevic met Sunday with Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov and Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev, Serbian President Milan Milutinovic and Yugoslavia's top defense officials.
Holbrooke said he would tell Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic of the extreme gravity of the situation.
The threats are serious, Prime Minister Momir Bulatovic said.
Serbian police and the Yugoslav army have routed separatist Kosovo Albanian rebels in the crackdown that began in late February.
Serb authorities appeared ready for compromise by installing an interim government in the rebellious province in Serbia, the dominant republic in Yugoslavia.
In Brussels, Belgium, however, U.S. special envoy Richard Holbrooke told reporters Monday that the situation in Kosovo has not improved.
Milosevic was apparently accusing Holbrooke of supporting the ethnic Albanian guerrillas of the Kosovo Liberation Army, who have been fighting to make the Serbian province of Kosovo an independent nation.
