Ten of the 11 countries adopting the euro dropped their interest rate to 3 percent.
Austria made the smallest cut, from 3.2 percent.
The 11 countries launching the common currency are Austria, Belgium, Ireland, Italy, Finland, France, Germany, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Spain and Portugal.
Rates before the cuts had varied throughout the future currency zone, from 3.69 percent in Ireland to 3.2 percent in Austria.
The coordinated rate cut could lead to a reduction in the current pessimism and a reduction in financial market turbulence, Tietmeyer said.
Making their first collective decision about monetary policy, the 11 European nations launching a common currency on Jan. 1 cut interest rates Thursday in a surprise move that won market confidence.
With the European Central Bank setting a common interest rate for the whole bloc, some economists fear the low rate designed to boost core EU economies like France and Germany may bring overheating in smaller nations with faster growth.
