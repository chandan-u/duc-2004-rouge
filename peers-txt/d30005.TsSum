Bin Laden is believed to be living in Afghanistan.
Police seized copies of the newspaper for reproducing a foreign newspaper interview of Afghanistan-based Saudi billionaire Osama Bin Laden, who has been accused by the United States of masterminding bombing attacks on the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in August.
This evidence was uncovered after the United States destroyed Idris factory in a missile attack following the bombing of the U.S. embassies, the officials said.
Federal authorities said that Khalid al Fawwaz, a London-based associate of bin Laden, directed Fazil to report periodically to bin Laden about the security situation of the cell.
Thus far, U.S. prosecutors have charged at least six members of bin Laden's organization with terrorist activities or conspiracy.
